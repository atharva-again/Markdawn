title: Markdawn vs Apple Notes
description: Compare Markdawn and Apple Notes for quick capture, shared pages, markdown portability, permissions, offline work, and AI assistant workflows.
---

Markdawn and Apple Notes solve different note-taking jobs. Apple Notes is optimized for capturing personal information quickly across Apple devices. Markdawn is designed for pages that need to become shared, structured, portable knowledge.

## The Short Answer

Choose **Apple Notes** when you want the fastest way to capture thoughts, scans, sketches, checklists, photos, and personal reference material on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

Choose **Markdawn** when notes need to be accessible in a browser, shared with people outside the Apple ecosystem, organized as project pages and folders, used by an AI assistant, or managed through markdown, the CLI, or the API.

Neither tool is universally better. The right choice depends on whether your primary job is fast personal capture or shared, portable knowledge.

## At A Glance

| Decision area | Markdawn | Apple Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main job | Shared project and team knowledge | Personal capture and reference |
| Access | Browser, CLI, API, and self-hosted deployments | Native Apple apps plus iCloud.com |
| Collaboration | Share pages with view, edit, or admin access with real-time coediting | Share notes and folders through iCloud |
| Collaboration boundary | Works for browser-based collaborators | Collaborators need an Apple device signed in to an Apple Account |
| Organization | Pages, folders, links, and backlinks | Folders, subfolders, tags, and Smart Folders |
| Portability | Markdown content, Markdown folders, and Obsidian vault imports | Markdown import and export on current Mac and iPhone versions; test archive migration |
| Automation | Documented CLI, API, and AI assistant workflows | Apple Shortcuts and Mac automation workflows |
| Native capture | Browser-based writing and imports | Quick capture, scans, sketches, checklists, photos, and Apple Share Sheet workflows |
| Hosting | Self-hosted option available | Stored and synced through Apple accounts and iCloud |

## Where Apple Notes Is Better

### Fast Personal Capture

Apple Notes has very little setup. You can create a note from an Apple device, capture a scan or sketch, add a checklist, and continue working across devices with iCloud.

Reddit users consistently describe this as Apple Notes' strongest advantage. One user wrote that “quick, off the cuff notes, shopping lists and other throw-away stuff” go into Apple Notes because of its “speed, convenience and sync.” Another wrote that Obsidian could not compete with how frictionless Apple Notes felt, including creating notes from the lock screen and using Siri.

This is a real advantage over a browser-first knowledge workspace. If the note has to exist in five seconds, Apple Notes is often the better tool.

### Apple-Native Media And Workflows

Apple Notes is a strong fit for handwriting, scans, photos, checklists, links, and information captured from other Apple apps. It also benefits from the native iPhone, iPad, and Mac experience.

Choose Apple Notes when the surrounding workflow matters more than a portable content format. It is especially well suited to personal shopping lists, receipts, handwritten notes, meeting scratchpads, recipes, and other information that does not need a shared project structure.

## Where Markdawn Is Better

### Shared Knowledge Across Devices And Teams

Markdawn gives pages a browser-accessible home. You can organize content into pages and folders, share pages with view, edit, or admin access, and keep a project knowledge base separate from any one person's device ecosystem.

Apple Notes does support shared notes and folders. However, Apple says that collaborators must use an Apple device signed in to their Apple Account. A Reddit user summarized the practical limitation by saying they would use Apple Notes only if sharing did not require the recipient to have an Apple account.

That distinction matters when you share documentation with clients, contractors, vendors, customers, or teammates using Windows or Android. Apple Notes can send a static copy to someone, but a static copy is not the same as shared, continuously updated project context.

### Markdown, Imports, And Portable Content

Apple Notes now supports Markdown import on current Mac versions, and Apple's Notes guide documents exporting a note as Markdown. It can also import folders while preserving their folder structure.

That makes Apple Notes more portable than it used to be. It does not eliminate the need to test a real migration. Before switching, check representative notes containing images, attachments, checklists, tags, links, tables, and nested folders. The result may differ between a simple text note and a rich Apple Notes archive.

Markdawn is built around a markdown-centered content layer. It supports Markdown files and folders, and it has a dedicated Obsidian vault importer for notes, images, tags, folders, and backlinks. Other note-taking apps are not treated as first-class imports, so the practical Apple Notes path is:

1. Export a representative set of Apple Notes as Markdown on a current Mac.
2. Keep the original Apple Notes archive untouched.
3. Import the resulting Markdown folder into Markdawn.
4. Check titles, images, links, lists, and folder structure.
5. Repeat with the complete archive only after the sample looks correct.

### API, CLI, And AI Assistant Workflows

Markdawn provides documented API and CLI workflows for reading, editing, importing, exporting, and organizing content. Its documentation also covers connecting AI assistants with controlled access to Markdawn pages.

Apple Notes can participate in Apple Shortcuts and Mac automation, but Apple does not document a public Notes API, dedicated official Notes CLI, or Notes-specific MCP server. Mac AppleScript is local app automation, not a cross-platform cloud API. Reddit users still ask how to export notes for AI workflows, and an Apple Developer Forum discussion describes the lack of a general Notes API equivalent to APIs such as Calendar's EventKit.

Choose Markdawn when notes need to be part of a repeatable content workflow rather than only a personal app.

### Hosting And Control

Markdawn has a self-hosting path for teams that want more control over deployment and data location. Apple Notes is tightly coupled to Apple accounts and iCloud for its full feature set.

This is not automatically a reason to leave Apple Notes. Self-hosting adds responsibility for backups, updates, security, and availability. It is a reason to consider Markdawn when infrastructure ownership is part of the requirement.

## Access And Collaboration Details

Apple Notes is not completely unavailable outside Apple's hardware. Apple provides iCloud.com access, and Apple Notes can sync across Apple devices signed in to the same account. The practical difference is that users outside the Apple ecosystem generally rely on the web experience.

Reddit discussions describe that web fallback as less capable than the native apps. Users mention browser friction, missing or inconsistent workflows, and difficulty working from Windows. Treat those reports as user experience signals, not universal product facts.

Markdawn is the better fit when the default access path should be a browser link rather than an Apple device or iCloud account.

## Scale And Reliability: Test Your Own Archive

Reddit contains separate reports about Apple Notes becoming slow around thousands of notes, search becoming slow or inaccurate, and iCloud sync failing across devices. These are anecdotal reports, and many Apple Notes users have large archives without problems.

If you have a large knowledge base, test both tools with your own archive. Measure search speed, opening time, sync behavior, attachment handling, and the time required to reorganize pages. Do not make a migration decision based only on a forum report or a feature checklist.

## Who Should Choose Apple Notes?

Apple Notes is a strong choice if you:

- Primarily use iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
- Need instant personal capture with minimal setup.
- Use handwriting, scans, checklists, photos, or Siri frequently.
- Share notes mostly with people who already use Apple devices.
- Do not need an API-first or markdown-first knowledge workflow.

## Who Should Choose Markdawn?

Markdawn is a strong choice if you:

- Need shared project context rather than private personal notes.
- Work with people on Windows, Android, or mixed device environments.
- Want pages, folders, links, backlinks, and explicit sharing permissions.
- Need Markdown, the CLI, the API, or AI assistant access.
- Want to import Markdown folders or an Obsidian vault.
- Need the option to self-host the application.

## Questions To Answer Before Switching

### Does Apple Notes Work On Windows?

Apple Notes is available through iCloud.com in a browser. Reddit users commonly describe this as a fallback rather than an equivalent to the native iPhone, iPad, and Mac experience. Markdawn is browser-first, so browser access is the primary workflow rather than a secondary one.

### Can Apple Notes Export Markdown?

Apple's current Mac and iPhone documentation supports exporting notes as Markdown and importing Markdown files. Test rich content and archive-scale migration before relying on the result.

### Can I Share Apple Notes With Someone Without An Apple Account?

Apple supports sending a copy, but live collaboration has Apple account and device requirements. If the recipient needs to edit shared project context in a browser without joining the Apple ecosystem, Markdawn is the closer fit.

### Is Markdawn Better For Quick Mobile Capture?

Not necessarily. Apple Notes has the advantage for native mobile capture, Siri, handwriting, scans, and Share Sheet workflows. Markdawn is better when the captured information needs to become shared, structured, portable project knowledge.

### Can I Import Apple Notes Directly Into Markdawn?

Markdawn does not currently describe Apple Notes as a first-class native import. Export Markdown from Apple Notes on a current Mac, then import the resulting Markdown folder and verify representative content.

title: Markdawn vs Confluence
description: Compare Markdawn and Confluence for Jira, enterprise governance, documentation, permissions, APIs, markdown portability, and self-hosting.
---

Markdawn and Confluence are both used for shared knowledge, but they are built for different levels of structure and administration. Confluence is Atlassian's team workspace for creating and sharing knowledge alongside Jira and other Atlassian products. Markdawn is a focused content layer for readable pages, folders, links, markdown, and controlled access.

## The Short Answer

Choose **Confluence** when your organization depends on Jira, Atlassian administration, spaces, page restrictions, macros, templates, enterprise integrations, or formal governance.

Choose **Markdawn** when your main need is durable shared knowledge that remains readable, markdown-centered, accessible through a browser, and available through the CLI, API, or an AI assistant.

Neither tool is universally better. Confluence provides a broader enterprise workspace. Markdawn provides a smaller and more direct content model with a self-hosting option.

## At A Glance

| Decision area | Markdawn | Confluence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main job | Shared knowledge and documentation | Enterprise team knowledge and collaboration |
| Ecosystem | Independent content layer | Strong fit for Jira and Atlassian workflows |
| Content model | Markdown pages, folders, links, and backlinks | Spaces, pages, templates, macros, attachments, and Smart Links |
| Collaboration | View, Edit, and Admin access with real-time coediting | Shared pages, comments, and space collaboration |
| Permissions | View, edit, and admin access | Site, space, page, and content restrictions with administrator roles |
| Automation | CLI, API, and AI assistant workflows | REST API, Jira integration, automation, Rovo, and Rovo MCP |
| Portability | Markdown content, Markdown folders, and Obsidian vault imports | Word, PDF, HTML, XML, CSV, and backup options; test migration behavior |
| Hosting | Hosted or self-hosted | Atlassian Cloud or self-managed Data Center |
| Best fit | Focused, portable shared knowledge | Governed knowledge across a larger Atlassian environment |

## Where Confluence Is Better

### Jira And Atlassian Workflows

Confluence is the natural choice when documentation must sit beside Jira projects, issues, dashboards, and workflows. Atlassian provides Smart Links and other integration features so teams can connect planning, delivery, and documentation without maintaining two unrelated systems.

Choose Confluence when your team already works in Jira and wants documentation to inherit the same organization, account structure, and administration model.

### Enterprise Administration And Governance

Confluence provides administration at multiple levels. Organizations can manage site or organization access, space permissions, page restrictions, groups, external users, and administrator roles.

That depth is useful when different teams need different spaces, sensitive pages need additional restrictions, or administrators need formal control over a large knowledge base. It also creates more permission behavior to understand and test than a small documentation workspace.

### Rich Pages, Macros, And Integrations

Confluence pages can combine prose with tables, attachments, templates, macros, Smart Links, whiteboards, databases, and third-party apps. Atlassian also provides AI features through Atlassian Intelligence and Rovo, depending on the product and plan.

This makes Confluence a better fit for a team portal, engineering handbook, product requirements space, incident documentation system, or knowledge base that depends on embedded Atlassian context.

### API, Rovo, And CLI Options

Confluence Cloud provides REST APIs, native automation, and the Atlassian Rovo MCP Server for compatible AI clients. Rovo MCP can search, read, create, and update Confluence content within the connected user's Atlassian permissions. Confluence Data Center has its own REST API surface, but Cloud Rovo MCP capabilities should not be assumed to apply to self-managed deployments.

Atlassian does not document a dedicated first-party Confluence content CLI as the primary interface. Atlassian's broader Teamwork Graph CLI and Rovo Dev CLI can support command-line agent workflows across Atlassian products, while direct Confluence scripting is usually built on the REST API.

### Cloud And Data Center Options

Confluence is available as a hosted Cloud product and as a self-managed Data Center product. Organizations can choose a deployment model based on their governance, infrastructure, compliance, and operational requirements.

Data Center is not a low-maintenance self-hosting option. It adds infrastructure, upgrades, backups, and administration responsibilities. Compare the operational burden with Markdawn's documented self-hosting path rather than treating both options as equivalent.

## Where Markdawn Is Better

### A Smaller Content Model

Markdawn is better when the main artifact is a page that people should be able to read, link, edit, export, and keep using without a large macro or application layer.

The same authored markdown can be read through the browser, CLI, and API. Pages can be organized into folders and connected with page links and backlinks. This keeps a decision record, research note, meeting note, or technical document understandable without requiring a space configuration or a collection of macros.

### Markdown And Content Portability

Markdawn is built around markdown as a content layer. It supports Markdown files and folders, and its Obsidian vault importer can bring in notes, images, tags, folders, and backlinks.

Confluence provides several export paths, including Word, PDF, HTML, XML, CSV, and instance backups. Those formats are useful, but they do not guarantee that macros, Smart Links, attachments, page restrictions, templates, comments, or app data will become clean Markdawn pages.

Choose Markdawn when readable markdown is a requirement rather than an output format you might use during a migration.

### Direct CLI, API, And AI Assistant Access

Markdawn provides documented CLI and API workflows for reading, editing, importing, exporting, and organizing content. Its documentation also covers connecting AI assistants with controlled access to Markdawn pages.

Confluence has APIs, apps, macros, automation, and Atlassian AI features. The difference is the unit being automated. Confluence automates a governed space with its page and app model. Markdawn automates a shared content layer made of pages, folders, links, and markdown.

Choose Markdawn when a script or AI assistant should work with durable pages without needing to recreate a full Atlassian workspace model.

### Flexible Sharing Without A Full Enterprise Workspace

Markdawn supports **View**, **Edit**, and **Admin** access for shared pages and folders. Use View for reading, Edit for changing content, and Admin for managing access and sharing settings.

This is useful for smaller teams that need explicit content permissions without adopting a full site, space, group, and page-restriction administration model.

## Search, Complexity, And Performance

Confluence's breadth can be a strength or a cost. A large installation may contain spaces, page trees, templates, macros, attachments, Jira links, app data, permissions, and multiple search behaviors.

Reddit discussions include complaints about search quality, slow Cloud experiences, and the difficulty of making basic page or table changes. One user said the search function was “absolute shit” and that changing table formatting was painful. Another user praised the Jira and Confluence integration but said Confluence's free-form pages became a pain.

These are user reports, not universal product facts. Test search, page loading, table editing, macro rendering, permissions, and navigation on a representative space before migrating or standardizing on either tool.

## Portability And Migration

Before moving from Confluence to Markdawn, inventory each space:

- Page hierarchy and page links.
- Macros, templates, Smart Links, and embedded content.
- Attachments, comments, labels, and metadata.
- Jira issue links and other Atlassian integrations.
- Page restrictions, space permissions, groups, and external access.
- Automations, marketplace apps, whiteboards, and databases.

Then keep the original Confluence space untouched, export a representative sample, convert the readable content to markdown where needed, and import that sample into Markdawn. Check titles, headings, tables, images, attachments, links, and folder structure before planning a complete migration.

Treat the migration as a content redesign when the source depends on macros, Jira context, permissions, or automation. A clean export is not the same as a feature-for-feature replacement.

## Who Should Choose Confluence?

Confluence is a strong choice if you:

- Already rely on Jira or other Atlassian products.
- Need spaces, page restrictions, groups, templates, macros, or enterprise administration.
- Need a rich team workspace with whiteboards, Smart Links, attachments, and apps.
- Want Atlassian Intelligence or Rovo features inside the knowledge workflow.
- Need Atlassian REST APIs, Rovo automation, or Rovo MCP access.
- Need Cloud or Data Center deployment options.
- Have administrators who can maintain governance, permissions, and integrations.

## Who Should Choose Markdawn?

Markdawn is a strong choice if you:

- Need shared documentation, decisions, research, or meeting knowledge.
- Want pages and folders instead of a large enterprise wiki configuration.
- Need Markdown, the CLI, the API, or AI assistant access.
- Want View, Edit, and Admin access without adopting Confluence's full administration model.
- Want to import Markdown folders or an Obsidian vault.
- Need the option to self-host the application.

## Questions To Answer Before Switching

### Is Markdawn A Replacement For Confluence?

Only for some workflows. Markdawn can replace Confluence as a home for shared documentation and durable knowledge. It is not a replacement for Jira integration, macros, marketplace apps, whiteboards, or Confluence's enterprise governance model.

### Does Markdawn Integrate With Jira?

Markdawn provides a documented API and CLI for content workflows, but this documentation does not describe a first-class Jira integration. If Jira issue links, Smart Links, or Jira-driven automation are central to the workflow, Confluence is the safer fit.

### Does Confluence Have A CLI?

Confluence has official REST APIs and Atlassian provides broader command-line tools such as the Teamwork Graph CLI and Rovo Dev CLI. The current Atlassian documentation does not describe a dedicated Confluence-only content CLI comparable to Markdawn's page CLI. Verify the tool coverage and Cloud or Data Center compatibility for the exact workflow.

### Can I Import Confluence Directly Into Markdawn?

Markdawn does not currently describe Confluence as a first-class native import. Export or retrieve a representative space, convert the readable content to markdown, and verify the result before planning a full migration. Macros, integrations, restrictions, and automations need explicit replacement decisions.

### Is Confluence Self-Hosted?

Confluence Cloud is hosted by Atlassian. Confluence Data Center is the self-managed offering. Confirm the current product, licensing, infrastructure, and support requirements before treating Data Center as a simple deployment alternative.

### Which Tool Is Better For AI Workflows?

Confluence provides Atlassian Intelligence and Rovo features within its Atlassian workspace. Markdawn provides a markdown-centered API and CLI, plus documentation for controlled AI assistant access. Choose based on whether the AI assistant needs to operate a governed enterprise workspace or read and change durable pages.

### Which Tool Has Better Permissions?

They solve different permission problems. Confluence provides layered site, space, page, group, and administrator controls. Markdawn provides View, Edit, and Admin access for shared content, with a smaller permission model. Test the exact external, inherited, and restricted-access cases your team needs.

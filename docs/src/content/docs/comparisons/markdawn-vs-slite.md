title: Markdawn vs Slite
description: Compare Markdawn and Slite for team documentation, collaboration, permissions, APIs, MCP, AI assistants, Markdown, and infrastructure control.
---

Slite is a hosted team knowledge product with collaborative documents, channels, comments, search, AI answers, an official API, and a remote MCP server. Markdawn is a more markdown- and infrastructure-oriented alternative for teams that want control over content and deployment, plus a first-class CLI and a smaller page and folder model.

Choose Slite for managed simplicity, a polished hosted workflow, permission-aware AI search, and agent integrations. Choose Markdawn when markdown portability, self-hosting, explicit API access, and a client-neutral content layer matter more than a full knowledge-management suite.

## Where Slite Is Better

### Managed Team Knowledge

Slite is designed to become a company's shared source of truth. Channels, nested documents, doc verification, document history, comments, search, and scheduled content workflows support a more managed documentation process than a simple page and folder application.

Markdawn is intentionally lighter. It is better when research, project notes, decisions, personal notes, and formal documentation should live together without requiring a knowledge-management panel or verification workflow.

### Real-Time Editing And Review

Slite's current plans include a real-time collaborative editor, comments, mentions, notifications, document history, and protections against accidental editing. This makes Slite a strong choice for team policies, onboarding, meeting notes, handbooks, and documentation that needs an ongoing review process.

Markdawn supports real-time coediting, collaborator presence, connection status, and direct page editing. It does not currently match Slite's complete comment, history, verification, and knowledge-maintenance workflow.

### Cascading Permissions And Guests

Slite permissions cascade from channels or parent documents to child documents, while allowing overrides at lower levels. Documents can be shared with specific team members without exposing the parent channel, and guests can receive Reader or Writer access to private documents and channels without becoming paid members.

Slite's workspace roles include Owner, Admin, Billing admin, Member, and Reader. External Guests are limited to the documents and channels shared with them.

Markdawn provides a simpler View, Edit, and Admin model for shared pages and folders. Choose Slite when cascading access, guests, workspace administration, and billing roles matter. Choose Markdawn when three explicit content roles are easier to operate.

### AI Search And The Slite Agent

Slite provides AI search and answers across Slite docs and connected sources. Answers can include citations, and permission checks are applied when content is retrieved. The current Slite Agent can detect documentation drift across connected tools, propose changes, show diffs, and route edits through human approval.

Slite Agent is available through the Slite UI, Slack, Claude, MCP, and API. Scheduled automations can review document channels and create a queue of changes for approval.

Markdawn documents controlled AI assistant access through its CLI and API. Choose Slite when an agent should maintain a verified knowledge base across many connected tools. Choose Markdawn when an AI assistant should work with a smaller Markdown content model.

### Built-In MCP

Slite provides an official remote MCP server at `https://api.slite.com/mcp`. It supports read and write access to Slite documents, collections, comments, tables, and other workspace objects, with more than 40 built-in tools listed in the current product documentation.

The MCP server uses OAuth for interactive clients and can also accept service-account keys for headless agents, CI pipelines, backups, and controlled automation. It inherits the permissions of the authenticated user or service account. Current Slite changelog information says MCP access is included on all plans, including Basic.

Markdawn also provides MCP support for its page and folder model. Slite remains stronger for teams that want an assistant to work across a broader knowledge-management surface with channels, comments, tables, and connected sources.

## Where Markdawn Is Better

### A Markdown-Centered Content Layer

Markdawn is better when the durable artifact should remain Markdown content organized into pages, folders, links, and backlinks. The same authored content can be read through the browser, CLI, and API without depending on a hosted knowledge-management system.

Slite supports Markdown export and Markdown imports, but its primary content model is collaborative documents inside channels. Choose Markdawn when Markdown portability is a core requirement rather than a convenient export option.

### Working Knowledge Before Publication

Markdawn is better when a research note, personal note, meeting record, incident page, or product decision should remain in the same system before and after it is shared with a team.

Slite is strongest when a team is intentionally curating a company knowledge base. It can hold private docs and shared channels, but it is more opinionated about documentation ownership, verification, AI maintenance, and workspace membership.

### A First-Class CLI

Markdawn provides a documented CLI for reading, editing, importing, exporting, and organizing content. Scripts and AI assistants can use the CLI against the same page model people use in the browser.

Slite provides an official public API, service accounts, webhooks, and MCP, but current official materials do not document a dedicated `slite` CLI. Developers can call the API with `curl`, generated clients, scripts, or automation platforms, and agents can connect through MCP.

Choose Markdawn when terminal workflows are a primary way to maintain content. Choose Slite when an API, webhook, or remote MCP integration is sufficient.

### Self-Hosting And Infrastructure Control

Markdawn has a self-hosting path for teams that want to control deployment and data location. Slite is a hosted SaaS product with EU-based infrastructure and managed security, compliance, updates, and availability.

Slite's managed model reduces operational work. Markdawn's self-hosting option adds responsibility for backups, updates, security, and uptime, but matters when infrastructure ownership is a requirement.

## APIs, Automation, CLI, And MCP

### Slite's Current Integration Surface

Slite's official integration surface includes:

- A public API built on the OpenAPI 3.0 standard for creating, updating, and searching docs.
- Service accounts with independent API keys and channel or document access controls.
- Read-only or read and write API key scopes for controlled automations.
- A remote MCP server for AI clients and custom agents.
- Slite Agent access through the app, Slack, API, and MCP.
- Zapier, Slack, connected-source search, and scheduled automations.

Service accounts are designed for integrations that should not depend on a person's account. They do not use a paid seat, can be restricted to specific channels or docs, and can use read-only or read and write keys. This gives Slite a stronger current service-account story than a simple personal API token.

Slite does not document a separate official CLI. The API is the scripting surface, and MCP is the agent surface.

Markdawn provides its own CLI, API, and MCP support today. Choose Slite when a managed API, service account, webhook, or broader MCP connection is the right tool. Choose Markdawn when the CLI and a smaller page-oriented assistant workflow should be part of the documented product workflow.

### AI Agents And Connected Sources

Slite Agent can search across Slite and connected tools such as Slack, Google Drive, Linear, GitHub, Jira, and other supported sources. The current product positioning emphasizes permission-aware retrieval, citations, scheduled checks, and human approval for changes.

Markdawn is narrower by design. Its CLI and API operate Markdawn pages and folders rather than acting as a unified search layer across many external systems. This can make the security boundary easier to understand, but it requires separate integrations for external sources.

## Collaboration, Roles, And Public Sharing

Slite supports real-time editing, comments, mentions, notifications, document history, and channel or document sharing. Public sharing can publish docs or channels to the web, and search engine indexing can be enabled for public docs.

Slite's document permissions use Reader and Writer access, with cascading inheritance from channels and parent docs. Team members can receive access to a single doc without seeing the parent channel. Guests can be invited as external collaborators with Reader or Writer access, and Slite currently allows up to five guests per paying member.

Markdawn provides View, Edit, and Admin access for shared pages and folders. It is a smaller model than Slite's workspace, channel, document, and guest model, but it makes the main content permissions direct and predictable.

## Portability And Migration

Slite supports individual document export in Markdown, HTML, and PDF formats. Exported documents do not include document history or comments, and large tables may be cut off. Slite also documents an API workaround for exporting a document and its subdocuments.

Slite supports bulk import of `.txt`, `.md`, `.doc`, `.docx`, and `.html` files. PDF files need to be converted before import. Dedicated import workflows are available for Notion, Google Drive, and Confluence.

Before migrating to Markdawn, inventory:

- Channels, docs, nested docs, links, comments, history, and verification state.
- Markdown, HTML, tables, images, files, embeds, and public links.
- Workspace roles, cascading permissions, guest access, and private channels.
- API keys, service accounts, MCP settings, webhooks, Slack, Zapier, and connected sources.
- Slite Agent schedules, pending approvals, citations, and document ownership.

Export a representative set of Slite documents as Markdown or HTML, preserve files separately, convert the content into Markdawn pages, and verify titles, headings, lists, tables, images, links, and folder structure before planning a full migration. Markdawn does not currently describe Slite as a first-class native import.

Moving from Markdawn to Slite requires the opposite conversion. Export Markdown and attachments, recreate channels and nested docs, and separately configure roles, guests, API keys, service accounts, MCP, webhooks, public sharing, and AI workflows.

## Offline Work And Hosting

Slite provides browser, desktop, and mobile applications, but its primary content is hosted in the Slite workspace. It is not a local-first Markdown vault, and the current product materials do not position it as a self-hosted or offline-first content store.

Markdawn is also a browser-oriented service, with a self-hosting option. Verify deployment, browser, and connection requirements for the workflow you need. Choose Markdawn when owning the deployment matters, not because either product should be treated as an automatic local file folder.

## Integrations And Security

Slite's API documentation states that it is SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR and HIPAA compliant, and uses EU-based infrastructure. The security model, SSO options, API permissions, service accounts, and MCP authorization should still be evaluated against your organization's requirements and plan.

Markdawn gives teams more deployment control through self-hosting, but the team assumes responsibility for infrastructure security, backups, updates, and availability. Managed compliance and self-managed infrastructure are different trade-offs, not interchangeable feature checkboxes.

## Pricing And Account Ownership

Slite's current pricing page lists:

- **Basic:** $10 per member per month.
- **Pro:** $20 per member per month.

Slite provides a 14-day free trial without a credit card. The current pricing and changelog materials say the old free plan has been replaced by paid subscriptions after the trial. Pro includes additional AI and knowledge-maintenance capabilities, including agent credits, while AI usage limits and features vary by plan.

The current changelog lists 50 monthly credits per Pro seat for agent actions, pooled at the workspace level, and says MCP access is included on all plans, including Basic. Confirm current billing, storage, AI credits, guest limits, and API availability before choosing a plan.

Markdawn pricing and deployment costs should be evaluated separately from Slite subscriptions. A self-hosted Markdawn deployment trades subscription simplicity for infrastructure responsibility.

## Questions To Answer Before Switching

### Is Markdawn A Slite Alternative?

Only for some workflows. Markdawn can replace Slite as a home for shared documentation, project context, and Markdown-centered knowledge. It is not a feature-for-feature replacement for Slite's doc verification, comments, cascading permissions, guests, connected-source search, Slite Agent, service accounts, or built-in MCP.

### Does Slite Support Real-Time Collaboration?

Yes. Slite's current plans include a real-time collaborative editor, and its product supports comments, mentions, notifications, and document history. Markdawn also supports real-time coediting, but uses a smaller Markdown page model and View, Edit, and Admin access roles.

### Does Slite Have An API?

Yes. Slite has a public OpenAPI 3.0 API for creating, updating, and searching docs, plus service accounts for integrations and AI agents. API keys and service-account access should be scoped to the minimum channels and documents required.

### Does Slite Have A CLI?

Slite does not document a dedicated official CLI. Use the public API, service accounts, webhooks, scripts, Zapier, or the remote MCP server for programmatic workflows.

### Does Slite Have MCP?

Yes. Slite provides the remote MCP server at `https://api.slite.com/mcp`. It supports permission-aware read and write access for compatible AI clients, uses OAuth or service-account credentials, and is currently listed as available across plans.

### Does Slite Have AI Features?

Yes. Slite provides AI search and answers across Slite docs and connected sources, plus Slite Agent for documentation drift detection, proposed fixes, scheduled reviews, and human approval. AI limits and agent credits depend on the plan.

### Can I Import Slite Into Markdawn?

Not as a first-class native import. Export representative Slite docs as Markdown or HTML, preserve attachments, convert them to Markdawn pages, and verify links, tables, images, and folder structure. Recreate Slite roles, guests, comments, history, service accounts, MCP, webhooks, and AI workflows separately.

### Is Slite Self-Hosted?

Slite is a hosted SaaS product. Current official materials describe hosted EU-based infrastructure and do not provide a self-hosted deployment option. Choose Markdawn when running the application on your own infrastructure is a requirement.

### Which Tool Has Better Permissions?

They solve different permission problems. Markdawn provides View, Edit, and Admin access for shared pages and folders. Slite provides workspace roles, cascading channel and document permissions, Reader and Writer access, guests, and public sharing. Choose the model that matches the people, teams, and external collaborators who need access.

title: Markdawn vs Coda (Superhuman Docs)
description: Compare Markdawn with Coda, now Superhuman Docs, for interactive docs, tables, formulas, automation, portability, and shared knowledge.
---

Superhuman Docs, formerly Coda, and Markdawn both help teams organize information, but they have different content models. Superhuman Docs turns a document into an interactive workspace with tables, formulas, buttons, automations, and Packs. Markdawn keeps the content layer focused on readable pages, folders, links, markdown, and controlled access.

> **Name update:** Coda became Superhuman Docs in July 2026. This page keeps “Coda” in comparison questions and source links because it remains the name many people search for, but the current product name is Superhuman Docs.

## The Short Answer

Choose **Superhuman Docs** when a document needs to behave like an application. Superhuman Docs is a strong fit for project trackers, planning systems, dashboards, approval workflows, structured databases, formulas, and automations.

Choose **Markdawn** when the main job is creating durable shared knowledge. Markdawn is a strong fit for decisions, research, meeting notes, documentation, markdown content, and pages that need to be read or managed through a browser, CLI, API, or AI assistant.

Neither tool is universally better. Superhuman Docs provides more workflow machinery. Markdawn provides a smaller and more portable content model.

## Where Superhuman Docs Is Better

### Interactive Documents And Structured Workflows

Superhuman Docs is designed for documents that combine prose with structured data. A team can put tables, filtered views, formulas, controls, buttons, and narrative instructions in the same document.

That makes Superhuman Docs a better fit for a roadmap with status logic, a project tracker with assignments, a launch checklist with buttons, an approval workflow, or a planning document that calculates values automatically.

Superhuman Docs' documentation, formerly the Coda Help Center, treats tables, formulas, buttons, automations, and Packs as connected building blocks. If those building blocks are central to the workflow, Markdawn is not a like-for-like replacement.

### Automation And Integrations

Superhuman Docs automations can respond to triggers and take actions. Buttons can update data or start a workflow from inside a document. Packs extend docs with integrations and actions from other services.

Choose Superhuman Docs when the document needs to actively run a process. This is the main reason to keep an important Superhuman Doc in Superhuman Docs instead of converting it into a collection of static pages.

### API, MCP, And AI Access

Superhuman Docs provides a public REST API and an official Docs MCP server. The API can work with docs, pages, tables, rows, formulas, controls, and publishing workflows. Docs MCP lets compatible AI clients read and write accessible docs and tables through `https://docs.superhuman.com/apis/mcp`.

The current official materials do not describe a separately branded Superhuman Docs CLI. CLI users can connect supported tools such as Claude Code or Codex CLI to Docs MCP, while scripts can use the REST API directly.

### Tables And Formula-Driven Data

Superhuman Docs is stronger when the team needs data that can be filtered, calculated, summarized, and reused across views. Its formula system and table relationships can support workflows that would be awkward as ordinary markdown pages.

Markdawn supports Markdown tables, page metadata, links, tags, and backlinks. Those features are useful for presenting information and connecting knowledge, but they are not intended to replace Superhuman Docs' table, formula, and application-building model.

### Superhuman Docs' Maker And Editor Model

Superhuman Docs' current billing model distinguishes Doc Makers from Editors. Editors are free and can collaborate in existing docs, while Doc Makers are the billable role for creating and managing docs. Creating a new doc or page, or using actions reserved for Doc Makers, can change the role and billing profile, so confirm the current workspace rules before scaling collaboration.

This model can work well when a small group creates documents and a larger group edits or contributes to existing documents. It needs careful governance when many people need to create new pages, use AI, or build workflows.

## Where Markdawn Is Better

### Durable, Readable Knowledge

Markdawn is better when the primary artifact is a page that people should be able to read, link, edit, export, and keep using without rebuilding an application model.

The same authored markdown can be read through the browser, CLI, and API. Pages can be organized into folders and connected with page links and backlinks. This keeps a decision record, research note, meeting note, or documentation page understandable without requiring a table schema or formula system.

### Markdown And Content Portability

Markdawn is built around markdown rather than treating markdown as an import format for a richer proprietary document model. It supports Markdown files and folders, and its Obsidian vault importer can bring in notes, images, tags, folders, and backlinks.

Superhuman Docs supports importing Markdown, but its central value comes from the interactive doc model built around tables, formulas, and connected workflows. Moving a Superhuman Doc into Markdawn therefore requires deciding what to preserve as content and what to redesign as a page workflow.

### API, CLI, And AI Assistant Workflows

Markdawn provides documented API and CLI workflows for reading, editing, importing, exporting, and organizing content. Its documentation also covers connecting AI assistants with controlled access to Markdawn pages.

Superhuman Docs also provides an API, MCP, Packs, automations, and Docs AI. The difference is the unit being automated. Superhuman Docs automates an interactive doc and its data model. Markdawn automates a shared content layer made of pages, folders, links, and markdown.

Choose Markdawn when an AI assistant or script should work with durable pages without needing to understand a large application-specific document model.

### Self-Hosting And Deployment Control

Markdawn has a self-hosting path for teams that want more control over deployment and data location. Superhuman Docs is a hosted service, so teams use Superhuman's infrastructure and account model.

Self-hosting adds responsibility for backups, updates, security, and availability. It is useful when infrastructure ownership is part of the requirement, not a default reason to leave Superhuman Docs.

## Portability And Migration

Superhuman Docs supports Markdown and CSV imports, PDF export for docs or pages, CSV export for tables, and account-data exports that can include `.txt` and `.csv` files. The current export documentation does not describe a general export that recreates an interactive doc as Markdown or HTML.

That distinction matters. A PDF can preserve a readable snapshot, but it does not preserve a working table, formula, button, automation, or Pack. A data export may preserve structured records without preserving the original document experience.

Before moving from Superhuman Docs to Markdawn, inventory each doc:

- Pages and prose that can become Markdawn pages.
- Tables that need to become ordinary Markdown tables or linked pages.
- Formulas and calculated fields that need a new workflow.
- Buttons, automations, and Packs that have no direct Markdawn equivalent.
- Permissions, embedded content, and external links that need retesting.

Then keep the original Superhuman Docs unchanged, export a representative sample through the format or API path available to your workspace, convert the readable content to markdown where needed, and import that sample into Markdawn. Treat the migration as a content redesign when the source depends on formulas or automations.

## Performance, Limits, And Mobile Workflows

Superhuman Docs publishes documentation for doc limits, performance improvements, rendering issues, and out-of-memory errors. That does not mean every Superhuman Doc becomes slow, but it does mean a large or heavily connected doc should be tested before it becomes a system of record.

Reddit discussions also surface two recurring concerns:

- A user asked whether a full HTML or Markdown backup was possible because PDF export did not feel sufficient for switching from Notion.
- An Android review described the mobile app as a limited companion to the web app.
- Another user wrote that they were still struggling with Coda formulas, before the rebrand to Superhuman Docs.

These are anecdotal reports, not universal product facts. Test the exact Superhuman Docs documents your team depends on, including mobile access, table loading, formula recalculation, automation behavior, and export recovery.

## Who Should Choose Superhuman Docs?

Superhuman Docs is a strong choice if you:

- Need tables, formulas, filtered views, controls, or buttons.
- Want a document to function as a lightweight application.
- Need workflow automations or integrations through Packs.
- Need the Superhuman Docs API or Docs MCP for connected tools and AI clients.
- Want project trackers, dashboards, approval flows, or operational systems.
- Have a clear governance model for Doc Makers, Editors, and AI usage.
- Prefer a hosted service over managing deployment and backups.

## Who Should Choose Markdawn?

Markdawn is a strong choice if you:

- Need shared documentation, decisions, research, or meeting knowledge.
- Want pages and folders instead of a database-first workspace.
- Need Markdown, the CLI, the API, or AI assistant access.
- Want to import Markdown folders or an Obsidian vault.
- Need content that can be read without recreating a Superhuman Docs-style app model.
- Want the option to self-host the application.

## Questions To Answer Before Switching

### Is Markdawn A Replacement For Coda Or Superhuman Docs?

Only for some workflows. Markdawn can replace Superhuman Docs as a home for shared documentation and durable knowledge. It is not a replacement for Superhuman Docs' relational tables, formulas, buttons, automations, or Packs.

### Can Markdawn Replace Superhuman Docs Tables?

Markdawn supports Markdown tables for readable content, but it does not provide the same formula-driven, relational workflow model. If the table is the application, keep it in Superhuman Docs or redesign the workflow before migrating.

### Does Coda Or Superhuman Docs Export To Markdown?

Superhuman Docs documents Markdown import, PDF export, table CSV export, and account-data export options. Do not assume that a complete interactive doc can be exported to Markdown with its formulas, buttons, automations, Packs, and relationships intact. Test the current export or API path for the specific document.

### Does Superhuman Docs Have An API Or MCP?

Yes. Superhuman Docs has a public REST API and an official Docs MCP server. Both operate within the connected user's access, while available actions and MCP limits depend on the role and plan. The current official materials do not describe a separately branded Superhuman Docs CLI.

### Which Tool Is Better For AI Workflows?

Superhuman Docs provides Docs AI, Packs, and automations inside its document model. Markdawn provides a markdown-centered API and CLI, plus documentation for controlled AI assistant access. Choose based on whether the AI assistant needs to operate a structured application or read and change durable pages.

### How Does Superhuman Docs Pricing Affect Collaboration?

Superhuman Docs bills for Doc Makers while Editors are free, but some editor actions can promote a user to Doc Maker. Check the current workspace settings and billing documentation before assuming that every contributor can create pages or use AI without changing the billable role mix.

### Can I Import Coda Or Superhuman Docs Directly Into Markdawn?

Markdawn does not currently describe Coda or Superhuman Docs as a first-class native import. Export or retrieve a representative sample, convert the readable content to markdown, and verify the result before planning a full migration. Tables, formulas, automations, and Packs will need an explicit replacement decision.

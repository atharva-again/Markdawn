title: Markdawn vs Obsidian
description: Compare Markdawn and Obsidian for Markdown files, collaboration, permissions, CLI, API, AI assistants, offline work, and self-hosting.
---

Obsidian is a local-first notes application built around folders of Markdown files, plugins, and personal knowledge workflows. Markdawn is a web-based shared content layer for teams that need browser access, real-time coediting, permissions, self-hosting, and a common place for people and AI assistants to work.

Choose Obsidian when the vault is the product and local files, offline work, plugins, and personal control are the priority. Choose Markdawn when shared pages need to stay current for a team and should be readable through a browser, CLI, or API.

## Where Obsidian Is Better

### Local Files And Offline Work

Obsidian stores notes as Markdown-formatted plain text files in a vault folder on the local filesystem. This makes the files easy to inspect, back up, process with other tools, and keep available without an internet connection.

Markdawn provides a browser-based page experience and can be self-hosted, but it is a service rather than a folder that is automatically present on every device. Choose Obsidian when offline access and direct ownership of the source files are non-negotiable.

### Plugins And Personal Workflows

Obsidian has a large community plugin ecosystem, a theme system, templates, properties, commands, and a TypeScript plugin API. Plugins can add calendars, databases, task workflows, importers, local integrations, and AI features.

This flexibility is a strength for individuals who want to shape their workspace. It also means that portability, security, updates, and team consistency depend on the plugins and settings each vault uses. Markdawn has a smaller and more inspectable page, folder, CLI, and API model.

### Official CLI And Headless Sync

Obsidian now provides an official CLI. After enabling it in the desktop app, the `obsidian` command can open, read, search, and write vault content, run commands, and support terminal and automation workflows. The desktop app must be running for normal CLI use.

Obsidian also documents headless Sync for automated environments. This can sync a vault to a server, support remote backups, feed other tools, and give agentic tools access to a vault without exposing the full computer. Headless Sync is a Sync client workflow, not a self-hosted replacement for Obsidian's Sync service.

### Personal Knowledge Graphs

Obsidian is designed for people who want to build a personal knowledge graph from linked notes, folders, properties, embeds, and plugins. Its local files and deep customization make it a strong fit for research, journaling, technical notes, and long-lived personal archives.

Markdawn is better when the knowledge needs a shared home with explicit access roles and browser-first collaboration rather than a highly customized individual workspace.

### Obsidian Sync And Publish

Obsidian Sync adds encrypted synchronization, version history, and shared vault collaboration. Obsidian Publish turns notes into hosted websites with themes, search, and publishing controls. Publish also supports collaborators who can publish changes to a site.

These services extend Obsidian beyond a single-device vault, but they remain separate from the local editing model. Sync shared-vault access requires an active Sync subscription for each collaborator. Markdawn includes shared-page collaboration in its application and uses one access model for working knowledge.

## Where Markdawn Is Better

### Browser-Based Shared Knowledge

Markdawn is better when a team should open the same current page in a browser, edit it together in real time, see collaborator presence, and continue working when connectivity changes. Shared pages support **View**, **Edit**, and **Admin** access.

Obsidian can support teams through Sync shared vaults and Publish sites, but those workflows require separate services and configuration. Obsidian Sync synchronizes vault files; it should not be presented as the same browser-native real-time coediting experience as Markdawn.

### Direct And Inspectable Permissions

Markdawn provides a smaller, explicit permission model:

- **View** allows reading shared content.
- **Edit** allows changing shared content.
- **Admin** allows managing access and sharing settings.

Obsidian permissions are split between local filesystem access, Sync shared-vault membership, and Publish site controls. That can work well for a personal vault or a controlled publishing workflow, but it is not the same page and folder access model.

### A Shared Content Layer For People And Tools

Markdawn pages are available through the browser, CLI, and API. The same page model can be used by teammates, scripts, and AI assistants without exposing a local vault or requiring every participant to install the same desktop application.

Obsidian's official CLI now narrows this difference for teams that are comfortable running the app or headless Sync. Markdawn remains simpler when the system of record should be a shared service with browser access, API authentication, and application-level permissions.

### Self-Hosting The Application

Markdawn has a self-hosting path for teams that want to control deployment and data location. Obsidian's local vault provides strong file ownership, but Obsidian Sync and Publish are hosted services. Running headless Sync on a server does not self-host the Sync backend.

Self-hosting adds responsibility for backups, updates, security, and availability. It matters when infrastructure ownership is a requirement, not merely a preference.

## Automation, APIs, CLI, And MCP

### Obsidian's Current Tool Access

Obsidian's current official developer surface includes:

- The official `obsidian` CLI for reading, searching, writing, and automating vault content.
- Headless Sync for running Sync workflows in server or automated environments.
- A TypeScript plugin API for building plugins inside the Obsidian application.
- The Obsidian URI scheme for opening vaults, files, searches, and commands.

Obsidian does not document a public hosted REST API for its vaults. Community plugins can provide local REST APIs, MCP servers, and other bridges, but those are plugin-based integrations that need their own security and maintenance review. Obsidian's official documentation does not present a first-party hosted MCP endpoint.

Markdawn provides a documented API, CLI, and MCP support for pages, folders, imports, exports, and access-controlled content. Choose Obsidian when local vault automation and plugin extensibility matter most. Choose Markdawn when a shared service API and controlled remote assistant access are the primary integration surfaces.

## Collaboration And Review

Obsidian Sync shared vaults let teams work from synchronized vault copies. All collaborators need active Sync subscriptions to access a shared vault. This is useful for teams that want to keep their working files in Markdown, but teams should test simultaneous edits, conflicts, plugin settings, attachments, and vault conventions before relying on it for critical shared documentation.

Obsidian Publish offers a different collaboration model. Site collaborators can publish changes, while the site owner controls the Publish site. This is suitable for maintaining a published knowledge site, not for giving every reader a browser editor for the underlying vault.

Markdawn is the better fit when collaboration happens directly on shared pages and the access question is simply whether someone can view, edit, or administer the content.

## Portability And Migration

Obsidian's core content is already Markdown files and attachments. That gives Obsidian a strong portability advantage. A vault can be copied, backed up, inspected, or processed without an Obsidian-specific export operation.

Moving an Obsidian vault into Markdawn still requires verification. Markdawn can import an Obsidian vault containing notes, images, and links between pages, but a vault's plugins, themes, commands, templates, CSS snippets, workspace layout, and `.obsidian` settings do not become Markdawn features automatically.

Before migrating, inventory:

- Markdown notes, folders, attachments, embeds, and links.
- Properties, frontmatter, templates, tags, and canvas or plugin-specific content.
- Community plugins, themes, CSS snippets, commands, and automation scripts.
- Sync shared-vault membership, Publish sites, custom domains, and site settings.
- Local AI, REST, MCP, or other plugin integrations and their credentials.

Keep an untouched copy of the original vault. Import a representative folder first and verify titles, headings, lists, images, links, and folder structure before planning a complete migration.

Moving from Markdawn to Obsidian is also a file migration rather than a one-click service transfer. Export Markdown and attachments, recreate folders and links, and separately replace Markdawn sharing, API, CLI, and deployment workflows.

## AI Assistants And Integrations

Obsidian's official CLI explicitly supports agentic tools that need to read, search, and write a vault. AI features can also be added through community plugins, including local or remote model integrations and community MCP or REST bridges.

This gives Obsidian a broad and flexible AI surface, but the security boundary is the local vault and the installed plugins. Review plugin permissions, model providers, credentials, and whether content leaves the device.

Markdawn documents controlled AI assistant access through its CLI, API, and MCP support, with page permissions applied by the application. The better choice depends on whether the AI assistant should operate a local personal vault or a shared, access-controlled content service.

## Pricing And Ownership

Obsidian's core apps are free to use. The current pricing page lists:

- **Sync:** $4 per user per month when billed annually, or $5 per user per month when billed monthly.
- **Publish:** $8 per site per month when billed annually, or $10 per site per month when billed monthly.
- **Commercial:** $50 per user per year for organizations that choose to support Obsidian commercially. Commercial payment is encouraged for organizational use but is not required to use the app.

Sync and Publish are paid hosted services. The local vault itself remains a folder of files under the user's control. Compare the cost of these add-ons with Markdawn's hosted plan or the infrastructure and maintenance required for a self-hosted deployment.

## Who Should Choose Obsidian?

Obsidian is a strong choice if you:

- Need local Markdown files and offline-first work.
- Want a personal knowledge graph with links, properties, plugins, and themes.
- Need the official Obsidian CLI or headless Sync for local automation.
- Want to keep control of the vault files and choose your own backup workflow.
- Need a hosted Publish site or Sync shared vaults and accept their separate service model.
- Are comfortable evaluating community plugins for AI, REST, MCP, and integrations.

## Who Should Choose Markdawn?

Markdawn is a strong choice if you:

- Need shared pages that people can edit in a browser in real time.
- Need View, Edit, and Admin access for shared pages and folders.
- Want a common service instead of distributing a local vault to every collaborator.
- Need a documented API and CLI for a shared content model.
- Want AI assistants and scripts to work with access-controlled pages.
- Want to import an Obsidian vault without adopting its plugin and desktop workflow.
- Need the option to self-host the application.

## Questions To Answer Before Switching

### Is Markdawn An Obsidian Alternative?

Only for some workflows. Markdawn can replace Obsidian as a home for shared documentation, project knowledge, and browser-based collaboration. It is not a replacement for Obsidian's local file ownership, offline-first workflow, plugin ecosystem, or personal knowledge graph customization.

### Does Obsidian Support Collaboration?

Yes. Obsidian Sync supports shared vaults, and Obsidian Publish supports site collaborators. Sync shared-vault collaboration requires an active Sync subscription for each collaborator. These workflows synchronize files or publish sites; they are different from Markdawn's browser-based real-time coediting with View, Edit, and Admin access.

### Does Obsidian Have A CLI?

Yes. Obsidian now provides an official `obsidian` CLI for reading, searching, writing, and automating vault content. Normal CLI use requires the Obsidian app to be running. Obsidian also documents headless Sync for server and automation environments.

### Does Obsidian Have An API Or MCP?

Obsidian provides a TypeScript plugin API and an Obsidian URI scheme. It does not document a public hosted REST API or first-party hosted MCP endpoint for vaults. Community plugins can add local REST and MCP integrations, so verify the plugin, security model, and maintenance status before using one with sensitive notes.

### Can I Import An Obsidian Vault Into Markdawn?

Yes. Markdawn supports importing an Obsidian vault, including notes, images, and links between pages. Plugins, themes, CSS snippets, workspace settings, and plugin-specific content need separate review and may require manual conversion.

### Which Tool Is Better For Offline Work?

Obsidian is stronger for offline work because the primary vault is a local folder of Markdown files. Markdawn is a browser-based service with a self-hosting option, so verify the deployment, browser, and connection requirements for the workflow you need.

### Which Tool Has Better Permissions?

They solve different problems. Markdawn provides View, Edit, and Admin access for shared pages and folders. Obsidian uses local filesystem access, Sync shared-vault membership, and Publish site controls. Test the exact private, shared, published, and external-collaborator cases your team needs.

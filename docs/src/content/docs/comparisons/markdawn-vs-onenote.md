title: Markdawn vs OneNote
description: Compare Markdawn and OneNote for notebook collaboration, Microsoft 365 workflows, APIs, exports, AI assistants, markdown content, and hosting.
---

OneNote is a flexible notebook application for typed notes, handwriting, sketches, recordings, images, attachments, and Microsoft 365 workflows. Markdawn is a focused shared content layer for teams that need browser-based markdown pages, real-time coediting, explicit access roles, self-hosting, and controlled CLI or API access.

Choose OneNote when notebook-style capture, handwriting, rich media, and Microsoft 365 integration are the priority. Choose Markdawn when the durable artifact should be readable markdown knowledge that people, scripts, and AI assistants can access through a client-neutral service.

## Where OneNote Is Better

### Rich Capture And Freeform Pages

OneNote is better for notes that combine typed text with handwriting, sketches, screenshots, photos, audio, video, files, tables, and freeform placement on a page. It is designed to feel like a digital notebook rather than a document tree.

Markdawn is intentionally narrower. Its main artifact is a readable markdown page organized in folders and connected with links. Choose OneNote when the capture surface matters more than Markdown portability.

### Microsoft 365 Context

OneNote fits naturally with OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams, Microsoft Graph, Outlook-adjacent workflows, Power Automate, and Microsoft 365 identity. Organizations already using Microsoft 365 can manage OneNote notebooks through the same account, storage, sharing, and administration environment.

Markdawn is a client-neutral content layer. It does not require Microsoft 365, but it also does not inherit Microsoft's identity, compliance, storage, and productivity integrations automatically.

### Real-Time Notebook Collaboration

OneNote supports shared notebooks and real-time collaboration. Notebooks stored in OneDrive or SharePoint can be shared with people or groups using view or edit permissions, and collaborators can work from the desktop, web, and mobile applications.

This is a strong fit for team notebooks, meeting notes, classroom materials, project binders, and working documents that benefit from a rich canvas. Markdawn provides real-time coediting on shared markdown pages, but it does not try to reproduce OneNote's ink, canvas, and notebook experience.

### Handwriting, Ink, And Media

OneNote is the better choice for pen input, diagrams, handwritten annotations, scans, voice notes, and embedded rich media. These are core parts of the product rather than content that must be represented in Markdown.

Markdawn is better when the result needs to remain text-first, linkable, exportable, and easy for scripts or AI assistants to process.

### Built-In Microsoft AI

Copilot in OneNote can summarize notes, rewrite content, create task lists, analyze ideas, and draft new content for eligible accounts and plans. Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Notebooks provide additional AI experiences around Microsoft 365 content, but their licensing and storage models are separate from the basic OneNote app.

Markdawn provides controlled AI assistant access through its CLI and API. Choose OneNote when Microsoft 365 Copilot is already part of the organization's workflow. Choose Markdawn when assistants should operate a smaller markdown model with application-level content permissions.

## Where Markdawn Is Better

### Markdown-Centered Knowledge

Markdawn is better when the durable artifact should remain Markdown rather than a rich notebook page. Pages can be read in the browser, CLI, and API, organized in folders, connected with page links, and exported for use in other Markdown tools.

OneNote's API returns and accepts structured HTML for page content. OneNote can export notebooks or pages to other formats, but it is not a Markdown-native storage workflow. A migration to Markdawn therefore requires content conversion and verification.

### Page And Folder Access

Markdawn provides a direct access model for shared content:

- **View** allows reading shared pages and folders.
- **Edit** allows changing shared content.
- **Admin** allows managing access and sharing settings.

OneNote sharing is primarily organized around a notebook stored in OneDrive or SharePoint. Microsoft's current sharing guidance says people can receive view or edit access to the notebook, and its personal OneDrive guide notes that single-page sharing was removed. Sharing a section link can still expose the entire notebook to people who have access.

Choose Markdawn when page and folder scope is central to the information architecture. Choose OneNote when notebook-level sharing fits the team's workflow.

### A Smaller And More Inspectable Content Model

Markdawn is built around pages, folders, links, and Markdown. This keeps the content model understandable without requiring a notebook canvas, Microsoft 365 storage location, or rich page HTML.

OneNote's richer model is valuable for capture, but it creates more to account for in exports, API integrations, permissions, and migrations. Markdawn is a better fit when the content needs to stay simple enough for people, scripts, and AI assistants to inspect directly.

### Self-Hosting And Deployment Control

Markdawn has a self-hosting path for teams that want control over deployment and data location. OneNote is a Microsoft-managed service backed by OneDrive or SharePoint. Microsoft Graph and local caching provide access and synchronization, but they do not provide a self-hosted OneNote server.

Self-hosting adds responsibility for backups, updates, security, and availability. It matters when infrastructure ownership is a requirement, not merely a preference.

## APIs, Automation, CLI, And MCP

### OneNote's Current Integration Surface

OneNote has a substantial official API surface through Microsoft Graph. Authenticated applications can work with notebooks, sections, and pages, including reading content, creating pages, updating page content, searching, and handling HTML with images and other supported elements.

The OneNote Graph API is a delegated-user API. Microsoft states that app-only authentication for the OneNote Graph API is no longer supported after March 31, 2025, so integrations should use delegated authentication and the current Microsoft Graph permissions.

Microsoft also provides Graph SDKs and a OneNote connector for Power Automate, Power Apps, Logic Apps, and Copilot Studio. The connector can create, read, update, and delete pages, work with sections, and trigger flows when pages or sections are created.

OneNote does not document a dedicated official `onenote` CLI. Developers can use Microsoft Graph Explorer, Graph SDKs, PowerShell, `curl`, or general Microsoft and Azure tooling, but those are ways to call Graph rather than a OneNote-specific command-line product.

Microsoft's current Graph MCP Server for Enterprise is a separate Microsoft Graph service and does not document OneNote notes scopes as a OneNote MCP interface. Microsoft has not published a first-party OneNote MCP server. Community MCP servers can wrap the Graph API, but they require independent security, authentication, and maintenance review.

Markdawn provides a documented API, CLI, and MCP support for pages, folders, imports, exports, and access-controlled content. Choose OneNote when Microsoft Graph and Power Automate are the integration center. Choose Markdawn when a smaller Markdown API, CLI, and controlled remote assistant connection are easier to manage.

## Collaboration And Permissions

OneNote notebooks must be stored in OneDrive or SharePoint to be shared. Microsoft supports inviting people or groups and choosing whether they can view or edit the notebook. OneNote's sharing unit is the notebook, not the individual Markdawn-style page and folder hierarchy.

Microsoft's current help also says that the ability to share a single page from personal OneDrive notebooks was removed. A section link can expose the entire notebook to people who have been given access, so test the exact sharing scope before using OneNote for mixed-private and shared knowledge.

Markdawn shares pages and folders with View, Edit, and Admin access and provides real-time coediting with collaborator presence. It is better suited to a knowledge base where different pages need explicit access boundaries.

## Offline Work And Storage

OneNote's desktop and mobile apps cache notebooks locally and synchronize changes with OneDrive or SharePoint when connected. This supports offline note-taking, but the exact behavior depends on the client, account, notebook location, local storage, and synchronization state.

Markdawn is a browser-based service. Verify the deployment, browser, and connection requirements for the workflow you need. Self-hosting gives more control over the service and data location, but it does not automatically turn Markdawn into a local notebook application.

## Portability And Migration

OneNote offers notebook export and import workflows, but the current Microsoft guidance has important limits:

- OneNote for the web can export notebooks stored on personal OneDrive accounts.
- The web export workflow does not work for notebooks stored on OneDrive for work or school or on SharePoint.
- Exporting a notebook produces a OneNote notebook archive rather than a clean Markdown folder.
- PDF export is available through supported desktop workflows, but it is a presentation format rather than an editable content model.
- OneNote's Graph API exposes page content as structured HTML, which can be converted to Markdown with a separate migration process.

Before migrating to Markdawn, inventory:

- Notebooks, section groups, sections, pages, and page hierarchy.
- Typed text, handwriting, drawings, images, audio, video, PDFs, attachments, tables, and tags.
- OneDrive or SharePoint locations, sharing links, view or edit permissions, and Teams tabs.
- Copilot-generated content, Power Automate flows, Graph applications, and connector credentials.
- Any page links, embedded files, or content that depends on the OneNote canvas.

Export a representative sample, convert structured content to Markdown, preserve attachments separately, and verify titles, headings, lists, tables, images, links, and folder structure before planning a complete migration. Markdawn can import a Markdown file, Markdown folder, or Obsidian vault, but OneNote is not currently a first-class native import.

Moving from Markdawn to OneNote also requires conversion in the other direction. Export Markdown and attachments, then recreate notebook, section, and page organization. Markdawn access roles, API credentials, CLI scripts, and self-hosting configuration do not transfer automatically.

## Pricing And Account Ownership

OneNote apps are available at no cost, while Microsoft 365 plans provide different combinations of OneNote, OneDrive storage, business identity, SharePoint storage, administration, and related applications. Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Notebooks require eligible licenses or plans and should be evaluated separately from basic OneNote access.

Markdawn pricing and deployment costs should be evaluated separately from Microsoft 365 licensing. A self-hosted Markdawn deployment trades subscription simplicity for infrastructure responsibility.

Check the current Microsoft 365 plan, OneNote storage location, Graph permissions, and Copilot license that apply to your organization before comparing total cost.

## Who Should Choose OneNote?

OneNote is a strong choice if you:

- Need handwriting, sketches, scans, audio, video, or rich attachments.
- Already use Microsoft 365, OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams, or Power Automate.

- Need Microsoft Graph access to notebooks, sections, and pages.
- Want Copilot features inside a Microsoft 365 note-taking workflow.
- Need offline work through supported desktop or mobile applications.
- Accept notebook-level sharing and Microsoft-managed hosting.

## Who Should Choose Markdawn?

Markdawn is a strong choice if you:

- Need shared Markdown pages that people can edit in a browser in real time.
- Need View, Edit, and Admin access for shared pages and folders.
- Want page links, backlinks, folders, and a durable text-first content model.
- Need a documented CLI and API for shared knowledge.
- Want AI assistants and scripts to work with access-controlled pages.
- Need to avoid Microsoft 365 as a requirement for your content layer.
- Need the option to self-host the application.

## Questions To Answer Before Switching

### Is Markdawn A Replacement For OneNote?

Only for some workflows. Markdawn can replace OneNote as a home for shared documentation, project knowledge, and Markdown-centered pages. It is not a replacement for handwriting, freeform canvases, rich media capture, Microsoft 365 context, or Copilot in OneNote.

### Does OneNote Support Real-Time Collaboration?

Yes. OneNote supports collaborative editing of shared notebooks stored in OneDrive or SharePoint. Microsoft describes real-time collaboration across its supported clients. Markdawn also supports real-time coediting, but with a Markdown page model and View, Edit, and Admin access.

### Does OneNote Have An API?

Yes. Microsoft Graph provides the official OneNote REST API for notebooks, sections, and pages, with delegated authentication. Microsoft also provides SDKs and a Power Automate, Power Apps, Logic Apps, and Copilot Studio connector.

### Does OneNote Have A CLI Or MCP?

Microsoft does not document a dedicated official OneNote CLI or first-party OneNote MCP server. Use Microsoft Graph, Graph SDKs, Power Automate, or general command-line tools for supported automation. Community MCP servers can wrap Graph, but they are not Microsoft-supported OneNote integrations.

### Can I Export OneNote To Markdown?

Not as a clean first-party Markdown export workflow. OneNote can export notebook archives, PDF files, and structured page content through Microsoft Graph. Convert a representative sample to Markdown and verify rich content before planning a migration into Markdawn.

### Can I Share A Single OneNote Page?

Microsoft's current sharing guidance says single-page sharing from personal OneDrive notebooks was removed. Sharing a section link can expose the entire notebook to people who have access. Use a separate notebook when the sharing boundary must be narrower, or choose Markdawn when page and folder sharing is the primary requirement.

### Which Tool Has Better Permissions?

They solve different permission problems. Markdawn provides View, Edit, and Admin access for shared pages and folders. OneNote uses OneDrive or SharePoint sharing, with people or links granted view or edit access to a notebook. Test private pages, shared pages, external collaborators, group membership, and inherited storage permissions.

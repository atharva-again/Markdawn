title: Markdawn vs Notion
description: Compare Markdawn and Notion for team knowledge, databases, collaboration, permissions, AI assistants, APIs, markdown portability, and self-hosting.
---

Markdawn and Notion are both used for shared knowledge, but they are built around different content models. Notion is an all-in-one workspace for pages, blocks, databases, teamspaces, projects, forms, sites, and AI. Markdawn is a focused content layer for markdown pages, folders, links, controlled access, and tool-driven workflows.

## The Short Answer

Choose **Notion** when databases, views, relations, formulas, templates, dashboards, teamspaces, project workflows, or broad integrations are central to the work.

Choose **Markdawn** when shared knowledge should remain markdown-centered, connected with page links and backlinks, accessible through the CLI, API, or an AI assistant, and available with a self-hosting option.

Neither tool is universally better. Notion is the broader workspace. Markdawn is the smaller and more direct content layer for durable knowledge.

## At A Glance

| Decision area | Markdawn | Notion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main job | Shared knowledge and documentation | All-in-one workspace for knowledge and work |
| Content model | Markdown pages, folders, links, and backlinks | Blocks, pages, databases, teamspaces, and templates |
| Structure | Folders, page links, and backlinks | Nested pages, databases, relations, views, formulas, and filters |
| Collaboration | View, Edit, and Admin access with real-time coediting | Members, guests, comments, teamspaces, and real-time coediting |
| Portability | Markdown content, Markdown folders, and Obsidian vault imports | Markdown, CSV, HTML, PDF, and file exports with conversion caveats |
| Automation | Markdawn CLI, API, and AI assistant workflows | `ntn` CLI, public API, webhooks, integrations, and Notion MCP |
| AI | Controlled AI assistant access to pages | Notion AI, Notion Agent, custom agents, and MCP |
| Offline work | Verify deployment and browser requirements | Selected pages in desktop and mobile apps, not web browsers |
| Hosting | Hosted or self-hosted | Managed application |
| Best fit | Durable, inspectable shared knowledge | Structured workspace with databases and workflows |

## Where Notion Is Better

### Databases And Structured Workflows

Notion's central advantage is its database model. A team can create databases with custom properties, views, filters, sorts, formulas, relations, rollups, subtasks, dependencies, forms, and charts.

This makes Notion a strong choice for project trackers, roadmaps, content calendars, CRM-style lists, issue queues, hiring pipelines, and any workflow where each item needs structured fields and multiple views.

Markdawn supports markdown tables and page metadata, but it is not a database replacement. Choose Notion when the workflow depends on querying structured records rather than reading and linking pages.

### Templates, Dashboards, And An All-In-One Workspace

Notion combines documents with tasks, projects, databases, forms, calendars, sites, and integrations. Templates can give a team a repeatable starting point, while dashboards and linked database views bring information from different parts of a workspace together.

This breadth reduces the number of separate tools a team needs. It also means a Notion workspace can become more complex to understand and migrate than a folder of markdown pages.

### Teamspaces, Guests, And Granular Permissions

Notion supports workspace members, guests, teamspaces, groups, and page-level permissions. Depending on the context, users can receive Full access, Can edit, Can edit content, Can create, Can comment, or Can view access.

Database pages can also use page-level access rules based on person or created-by properties. This is useful for workflows where contributors should create or edit their own records without seeing or changing everyone else's records.

Markdawn's View, Edit, and Admin model is easier to explain, but Notion provides more permission states for complex workspaces.

### Real-Time Collaboration And Review

Notion and Markdawn both support real-time coediting. Notion adds comments, mentions, page sharing, teamspace membership, and a rich block editor. Notion also shows collaborator avatars and activity while people are working on the same page.

Choose Notion when collaboration needs database-specific permissions, comments, structured records, and a broad workspace model. Choose Markdawn when collaborators should edit the same markdown-centered page with a smaller access model.

### Notion Sites And Publishing

Notion can publish pages as Notion Sites. Depending on the plan, published pages can use search engine indexing, site customization, custom domains, branding, and analytics.

This makes Notion useful when a team wants to publish selected workspace content without operating a separate site. Markdawn has a documentation site and self-hosting path, but its main comparison advantage is content ownership and inspectable markdown rather than Notion's all-in-one publishing workflow.

### Notion AI, Agents, And MCP

Notion provides Notion AI, Notion Agent, custom agents, API connections, and the official hosted Notion MCP server at `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`. Notion MCP lets compatible AI apps such as Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and Codex read from and write to Notion pages while respecting the connected user's Notion permissions.

Notion's current AI tooling is a serious strength, especially for teams that want agents to work across databases, pages, and connected services. Markdawn also provides API and CLI workflows plus controlled AI assistant access, but its automation surface is intentionally centered on pages, folders, links, and markdown.

### Notion CLI And Workers

Notion also provides the official `ntn` command-line tool, currently in public beta. The CLI can authenticate to a workspace, make authenticated Notion API requests, create and query data sources, upload files, and manage Notion Workers from a terminal. It supports browser-based login and personal access tokens for unattended workflows.

The CLI is available on Notion plans, while deploying and managing Notion Workers requires the plan and workspace access described in Notion's current documentation. This means Notion is not merely a browser-based competitor to Markdawn. It has a real terminal and developer workflow through `ntn`.

## Where Markdawn Is Better

### Markdown As The Authored Content Model

Markdawn is better when markdown is not just an export format. The authored page content remains readable as markdown and can be accessed through the browser, CLI, and API.

Notion can export non-database pages as Markdown, but database pages export as CSV with Markdown files for subpages. Some blocks also need conversion. Callout blocks, for example, are exported as HTML because Markdown has no direct equivalent in Notion's exporter.

Choose Markdawn when a page needs to remain portable and inspectable throughout its lifetime, not only when someone requests an export.

### Pages, Folders, And Backlinks

Markdawn is designed for connected documentation. A page can link to another page, live in a folder, and be discovered through backlinks. This is useful for product decisions, technical documentation, research, runbooks, and knowledge that needs an explicit structure over time.

Notion's nested pages, relations, and linked database views are powerful, but they create a different kind of structure. Choose Markdawn when the relationship between documents should be represented by ordinary page links rather than database properties or workspace views.

### A Smaller Permission Model

Markdawn supports **View**, **Edit**, and **Admin** access for shared pages and folders. Use View for reading, Edit for changing content, and Admin for managing access and sharing settings.

Notion's permission system is more granular, but it also has more interactions between workspace membership, teamspaces, guests, parent pages, subpages, databases, and the broadest access a person receives. Markdawn is a better fit when a small team wants roles that can be understood at a glance.

### Real-Time Coediting With Markdown Pages

Markdawn supports multiple collaborators editing the same shared page in real time. Users with Edit or Admin access can work together while Markdawn shows live collaboration status and collaborator presence.

If the collaboration connection is lost, Markdawn switches the editor to read-only until it reconnects. This keeps edits from being made against a stale document while preserving the shared-page workflow.

### CLI, API, And AI Assistant Access

Markdawn provides documented CLI and API workflows for reading, editing, importing, exporting, and organizing content. Its documentation also covers connecting AI assistants with controlled access to Markdawn pages.

Notion provides the official `ntn` CLI, public API, webhooks, integrations, and MCP. The difference is the unit being automated. Notion automates a block workspace with databases and page permissions. Markdawn automates pages, folders, links, and markdown.

### Self-Hosting And Deployment Control

Markdawn has a self-hosting path for teams that want control over deployment and data location. Notion is a managed application and does not provide a self-hosted deployment comparable to Markdawn.

Self-hosting adds responsibility for backups, updates, security, and availability. It matters when infrastructure ownership is a requirement, not merely a preference.

## Portability And Migration

Notion has stronger export options than many workspace products. Individual pages and databases can be exported as PDF, HTML, or Markdown and CSV. Entire workspaces can be exported as HTML, Markdown, or CSV, along with uploaded files and a sitemap.

The export is not a complete workspace reconstruction. Database views, relations, formulas, automations, permissions, teamspaces, comments, and AI context need separate decisions. Notion's own documentation says an exported workspace cannot be instantly recreated by reuploading the exported files.

Before moving from Notion to Markdawn, inventory:

- Pages, subpages, databases, views, and templates.
- Relations, rollups, formulas, buttons, forms, and automations.
- Files, images, embeds, callouts, code blocks, and synced content.
- Comments, guests, members, teamspaces, and page-level permissions.
- Notion Sites, custom domains, analytics, and public links.
- Notion AI, Notion MCP, API connections, webhooks, and integrations.

Export a representative sample with Markdown and CSV, keep the original workspace untouched, and import the readable pages into Markdawn. Convert database records into pages or Markdown tables only after deciding which information needs to remain structured.

Test headings, lists, tables, page links, images, files, callouts, code blocks, and nested page structure. Notion's exporter can also take a long time for large workspaces, and community discussions include reports of formatting differences and failed Markdown or CSV exports.

## Offline Work And Sync

Notion supports offline pages in its desktop and mobile apps, but offline use is not available in web browsers. Pages need to be downloaded individually, while paid plans can automatically download recently visited and favorited pages. Database offline downloads are limited to the first 50 rows of the first view.

Notion also documents conflict risks for some offline non-text edits. Test downloaded pages, databases, embeds, images, and reconnection behavior before depending on offline work.

Markdawn is browser-first and should be evaluated against your deployment and network requirements. Its advantage is deployment ownership, not a claim of matching Notion's app-level offline workflow.

## Pricing And Workspace Scale

Notion's paid plans charge per workspace member. Guests can access individual pages without being full workspace members, but guest limits, teamspaces, database permissions, AI, page history, custom domains, and security controls vary by plan.

Notion's current pricing page also separates features such as Notion Agent, AI Meeting Notes, Enterprise Search, advanced security, and custom agents. Check the current plan comparison and calculate the cost for the members, guests, databases, AI usage, and publishing features you actually need.

Markdawn pricing and deployment costs should be evaluated separately from Notion's per-member billing. A self-hosted Markdawn deployment trades subscription simplicity for infrastructure responsibility.

## Who Should Choose Notion?

Notion is a strong choice if you:

- Need databases, relations, formulas, views, forms, charts, or dashboards.
- Want an all-in-one workspace for docs, projects, tasks, and team knowledge.
- Need teamspaces, guests, groups, and granular page or database permissions.

Markdawn is a strong choice if you:

- Need shared documentation, decisions, research, or meeting knowledge.
- Want markdown as the authored content model instead of an export option.
- Need page links, backlinks, and folders as part of the knowledge model.
- Need multiple collaborators to edit shared pages in real time.
- Need View, Edit, and Admin access for shared pages and folders.
- Want a CLI, API, or AI assistant centered on durable markdown pages.
- Want to import Markdown folders or an Obsidian vault.
- Need the option to self-host the application.

## Questions To Answer Before Switching

### Is Markdawn A Replacement For Notion?

Only for some workflows. Markdawn can replace Notion as a home for shared documentation, connected notes, and real-time collaborative pages. It is not a replacement for databases, relations, formulas, dashboards, forms, Notion Sites, or Notion's broader workspace model.

### Does Notion Support Markdown?

Yes. Notion can export non-database pages as Markdown and full-page databases as CSV with Markdown files for subpages. Some blocks require conversion, and database views, formulas, relations, and permissions do not become equivalent Markdown content.

### Does Notion Support Real-Time Coediting?

Yes. Notion and Markdawn both support real-time coediting. Notion adds comments, database collaboration, teamspaces, and more permission levels. Markdawn provides real-time editing for shared markdown pages with View, Edit, and Admin access.

### Does Notion Support AI Assistants?

Yes. Notion provides Notion AI, Notion Agent, custom agents, a public API, and the official hosted Notion MCP server. Notion MCP can let compatible AI apps read and write pages while respecting Notion permissions. Markdawn provides API and CLI workflows plus controlled AI assistant access to pages.

### Does Notion Have A CLI?

Yes. Notion's official `ntn` CLI is currently in public beta. It can authenticate to a workspace, make API requests, create and query data sources, upload files, and manage Notion Workers. Use `ntn login` for browser authorization or `NOTION_API_TOKEN` for unattended scripts and CI. Compare `ntn` with the Markdawn CLI based on content model, authentication, deployment, and the workflows each command surface supports.

### Can I Import Notion Directly Into Markdawn?

Markdawn does not currently describe Notion as a first-class native import. Export pages as Markdown and databases as CSV, preserve assets, convert the content into Markdawn pages, and verify a representative sample before planning a full migration.

### Is Notion Self-Hosted?

Notion is a managed application. It does not provide a self-hosted deployment comparable to Markdawn. Choose Markdawn when owning the deployment and data location is a requirement.

### Which Tool Has Better Permissions?

They solve different permission problems. Notion provides members, guests, teamspaces, Full access, Can edit, Can edit content, Can create, Can comment, and Can view roles. Markdawn provides View, Edit, and Admin access for shared content with a smaller permission model. Test the exact external, inherited, and restricted-access cases your team needs.

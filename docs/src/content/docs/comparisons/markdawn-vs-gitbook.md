title: Markdawn vs GitBook
description: Compare Markdawn and GitBook for technical documentation, publishing, Git sync, AI access, Markdown, APIs, and self-hosting.
---

Markdawn and GitBook are both used to create documentation, but they optimize for different stages of the work. GitBook is a documentation platform for writing, reviewing, publishing, and maintaining polished docs sites. Markdawn is a shared knowledge layer for pages, folders, links, markdown, controlled access, and tool-driven workflows.

## The Short Answer

Choose **GitBook** when the main output is a polished public, private, or customer-facing documentation site with custom domains, navigation, search, review workflows, Git sync, and AI discovery.

Choose **Markdawn** when the main need is working knowledge that should remain markdown-centered, easy to inspect, connected with page links, accessible through the CLI, API, or an AI assistant, and available with a self-hosting option.

Neither tool is universally better. GitBook is the stronger documentation publishing system. Markdawn is the more direct content layer for knowledge that is still being created, organized, and reused.

## Where GitBook Is Better

### Publishing A Documentation Site

GitBook is designed to turn a space into a documentation site. Teams can configure navigation, branding, custom domains, site settings, search, analytics, redirects, authenticated access, and other publishing features depending on the plan.

This makes GitBook a strong choice when the reader experience is a product requirement. A customer should be able to arrive at a branded site, browse a clear information architecture, search the documentation, and receive a consistent presentation without the team building that publishing layer themselves.

### Technical Documentation Workflows

GitBook supports content structures built around pages, sections, Markdown, code blocks, images, embeds, and other documentation elements. It is particularly suited to API references, developer guides, product documentation, changelogs, and help centers.

Its editor is optimized for documentation rather than general-purpose notes. Authors can write in GitBook, import Markdown, or connect a repository through Git Sync.

### GitHub And GitLab Synchronization

GitBook supports Git Sync with GitHub and GitLab. The integration can synchronize Markdown content between a repository and a GitBook space, with changes flowing in both directions according to the configured workflow.

This is a meaningful strength for engineering teams that want a friendly documentation site while keeping content near the codebase. It also means teams need to establish a clear source-of-truth and review process. Repository changes, GitBook edits, generated files, and navigation configuration must be tested together.

### Review, Version History, And Change Requests

GitBook provides version history for space content and change requests for proposing and reviewing documentation changes. This supports a more formal documentation workflow than simply sharing an editable page.

Use GitBook when documentation needs review ownership, inline discussion, approval, a publishing step, or a visible history of changes. Markdawn is better suited to direct page editing and working knowledge unless your team adds its own review process around the API or repository.

### AI Discovery And Published-Docs Access

GitBook has built AI features into both authoring and publishing. GitBook Agent can help create, review, and maintain documentation. GitBook Assistant can help visitors find answers within a published docs site. Published GitBook sites can also provide an MCP server so compatible AI assistants and developer tools can access the documentation directly.

Markdawn also documents AI assistant access through its API and content permissions. The distinction is where the assistant works. GitBook is optimized for answering questions from a published documentation site. Markdawn is optimized for controlled access to working pages and shared knowledge.

### GitBook CLI And API

GitBook has an official developer CLI for authenticating, developing, and publishing GitBook integrations, OpenAPI content, and related workflows. It is not the same as the deprecated legacy `gitbook-cli` used to build older local GitBook books.

GitBook also provides a REST API for spaces, pages, sites, permissions, change requests, comments, analytics, integrations, and imports. This gives GitBook a broader developer surface than a docs-site editor alone.

## Where Markdawn Is Better

### Working Knowledge Before Publication

Markdawn is better when the content is still being discovered, discussed, organized, and changed. A research note, meeting note, product decision, incident record, or internal brief can remain in the same page and folder system before it becomes documentation.

GitBook can be used privately, but its strongest product model is documentation that has an audience and a publishing workflow. Markdawn is a better fit when the knowledge base is not primarily a public docs site.

### A Smaller And More Inspectable Content Model

Markdawn is built around pages, folders, links, and markdown. The same content can be read through the browser, CLI, and API. This keeps a page understandable without requiring a published site configuration, repository build, or documentation-specific block rendering.

GitBook supports Markdown, but GitBook also adds its own space, navigation, publishing, and synchronization model. Choose Markdawn when the content itself should remain the simplest durable artifact.

### Direct Access Roles For Shared Content

Markdawn supports **View**, **Edit**, and **Admin** access for shared pages and folders. Use View for reading, Edit for changing content, and Admin for managing access and sharing settings.

GitBook provides organization and space permissions, change requests, authenticated docs sites, and publishing controls. Those capabilities are stronger for governed documentation, but they can be more configuration than a small team needs for shared working knowledge.

### Self-Hosting And Deployment Control

Markdawn has a self-hosting path for teams that want control over deployment and data location. GitBook's current platform is a managed SaaS product. The existence of the older open-source GitBook project or an open-source frontend should not be treated as a self-hosting option for the current GitBook service.

Self-hosting adds responsibility for backups, updates, security, and availability. It matters when infrastructure ownership is a requirement, not merely a preference.

### CLI, API, And Content Automation

Markdawn provides documented CLI and API workflows for reading, editing, importing, exporting, and organizing content. Its documentation also covers connecting AI assistants with controlled access to Markdawn pages.

GitBook provides an official CLI, API, Git Sync, AI integrations, and two MCP patterns: a workflow MCP for managing GitBook content and a read-only MCP endpoint for published docs. The difference is the content model being automated. GitBook is optimized for spaces and docs sites. Markdawn is optimized for pages, folders, links, and markdown.

## Publishing And Audience

GitBook is the better choice when readers outside the authoring team are central to the workflow. Its docs-site features support branded navigation, custom domains, public or authenticated access, search, feedback, analytics, redirects, and AI-assisted discovery.

Markdawn is better when the same content serves authors, teammates, scripts, and AI assistants before it becomes a polished public site. It provides a direct page experience but should not be presented as a feature-for-feature replacement for GitBook's publishing and audience layer.

## Portability And Migration

GitBook supports importing multiple pages from a ZIP containing Markdown or HTML, and it recommends Markdown for the best results. It can also import or synchronize content from GitHub and GitLab through Git Sync.

Before moving from GitBook to Markdawn, inventory each space:

- Pages, sections, navigation files, and redirects.
- Markdown, code blocks, images, embeds, and attachments.
- Git Sync configuration, repository branches, and source-of-truth rules.
- Change requests, version history, comments, and unpublished drafts.
- Custom domains, authenticated access, adaptive content, and site settings.
- Assistant, MCP, analytics, and integration configuration.

Export or retrieve a representative sample, convert the readable content to Markdawn pages, and verify titles, headings, code blocks, images, links, and folder structure before planning a complete migration. A GitBook site configuration, custom domain, access policy, or MCP endpoint does not automatically become Markdawn configuration.

## Search, Navigation, And Complexity

GitBook's navigation, search, published-site structure, and docs-specific features are strengths when a documentation set has many readers and a clear information architecture. They also create more configuration to maintain than a simple page and folder system.

Community discussions have included requests for more flexible personal space limits, searches for free alternatives, and interest in self-hosted replacements. Other users praise GitBook's appearance, organization, and Markdown workflow. Check current plans and test the exact space, site, and collaboration limits before committing to a long-term documentation architecture.

## Who Should Choose GitBook?

GitBook is a strong choice if you:

- Need a polished public, private, or customer-facing docs site.
- Want custom domains, branded navigation, search, analytics, or redirects.
- Need GitHub or GitLab synchronization for Markdown documentation.
- Want change requests, version history, and a formal review workflow.
- Need authenticated access or adaptive content for different audiences.
- Want GitBook Assistant, GitBook Agent, or MCP access for published docs.
- Need the GitBook CLI or API for integrations, sites, content, and analytics.
- Prefer a managed documentation platform.

## Who Should Choose Markdawn?

Markdawn is a strong choice if you:

- Need shared documentation, decisions, research, or meeting knowledge.
- Want working knowledge before it becomes a published docs site.
- Prefer a markdown-centered content layer with pages, folders, and links.
- Need View, Edit, and Admin access for shared pages and folders.
- Need the CLI, API, or AI assistant access to durable pages.
- Want to import Markdown folders or an Obsidian vault.
- Need the option to self-host the application.

## Questions To Answer Before Switching

### Is Markdawn A Replacement For GitBook?

Only for some workflows. Markdawn can replace GitBook as a home for shared documentation and working knowledge. It is not a replacement for GitBook's hosted docs-site customization, Git Sync, change requests, authenticated publishing, audience analytics, or published-doc MCP features.

### Does GitBook Support Markdown?

Yes. GitBook supports Markdown in its editor and recommends Markdown when importing content. It can also synchronize Markdown files from GitHub or GitLab through Git Sync.

### Does GitBook Support AI Assistants?

Yes. GitBook provides AI authoring and review features, GitBook Assistant for published docs, and MCP servers for published documentation. Markdawn provides documented API and CLI workflows plus controlled AI assistant access to pages. Compare whether the assistant needs public documentation context or private working knowledge.

### Does GitBook Have A CLI?

Yes. GitBook's current developer CLI is used for integrations, development, authentication, and publishing workflows. The older open-source `gitbook-cli` for local book builds is deprecated and should not be confused with the current GitBook.com developer CLI.

### Can I Import GitBook Directly Into Markdawn?

Markdawn does not currently describe GitBook as a first-class native import. Retrieve or export Markdown content, preserve images and links, and verify a representative sample before planning a full migration. Recreate site settings, access rules, redirects, review history, and integrations separately.

### Is GitBook Self-Hosted?

The current GitBook platform is managed SaaS. An older open-source GitBook project and open-source frontend exist, but they are not the same as self-hosting the current GitBook service. Choose Markdawn when owning the deployment is a requirement.

### Which Tool Is Better For AI-Readable Documentation?

Both can support AI retrieval. GitBook provides Markdown documentation, published-doc MCP servers, and AI features designed for public or private docs sites. Markdawn provides Markdown content, API and CLI access, and controlled page permissions. Choose based on whether you need a published docs knowledge source or a working knowledge layer.

title: Markdown Support In Markdawn
description: See which markdown syntax Markdawn supports, how page links and frontmatter work, and which features remain partial.
---

Markdawn uses markdown for page content, with a few product-specific extensions. The same authored markdown can be read through the browser, CLI, and API.

## Supported Markdown

| Syntax | Status | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headings | Supported | `## Project Notes` |
| Bold and italic text | Supported | `**bold**` and `*italic*` |
| Strikethrough | Supported | `~~removed text~~` |
| Inline code | Supported | ``npm run dev`` |
| Links | Supported | `[Markdawn](https://markdawn.space)` |
| Images | Supported | `![Alt text](https://example.com/image.png)` |
| Bulleted and numbered lists | Supported | `- One` and `1. One` |
| Task lists | Supported | `- [ ] Todo` and `- [x] Done` |
| Blockquotes | Supported | `> A quoted line` |
| Fenced code blocks | Supported | Triple backticks with an optional language |
| Tables | Supported | GitHub Flavored Markdown tables |
| Horizontal rules | Supported | `---` |
| Inline math | Supported | `$E=mc^2$` |
| Block math | Supported | A `$$` block rendered as LaTeX math |
| Page links | Supported | `[[Project Notes]]` |
| Page links with labels | Supported | `[[Project Notes | Read the notes]]` |
| Page links to headings | Supported | `[[Project Notes#Decisions]]` |
| Inline tags | Supported | `#research` |

## Page Links

Use double brackets when one Markdawn page should link to another:

```markdown
[[Project Notes]]
[[Project Notes | Read the notes]]
[[Project Notes#Decisions]]
```

The editor suggests matching pages while you type. The double-bracket syntax is the underlying markdown form.

Use page links when a page refers to information that already exists elsewhere. This keeps the source page shorter and gives readers a path to the related context.

## Callouts Are Partially Supported

The editor recognizes `NOTE`, `TIP`, `WARNING`, `DANGER`, `INFO`, and `EXAMPLE` callouts:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Keep this detail in mind.
```

Support is currently partial. If you import or create a page through the API or CLI, verify how the callout renders in the browser before relying on it. GitHub callout types such as `IMPORTANT` and `CAUTION` are not currently recognized as Markdawn callout types.

## Frontmatter

A page can begin with YAML frontmatter for page properties and an icon:

```yaml
---
icon: lightbulb
tags:
  - project
  - planning
status: active
---
```

Frontmatter is metadata, not visible page content. A page title is separate metadata, so do not add a duplicate H1 just to set the page title.

## Not Currently Rendered

| Syntax | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Mermaid diagrams | A fenced `mermaid` block stays a code block. |
| Raw HTML | HTML is not a supported page layout language. |
| Footnotes | No dedicated footnote rendering is available. |
| `IMPORTANT` and `CAUTION` callouts | Treated as ordinary quote content. |
| Arbitrary custom directives | No directive syntax is defined. |
| Embedded third-party widgets | Use a normal link instead. |

For portable content, prefer headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, code blocks, and ordinary blockquotes.
